Lightstone

This is a skeleton implementation of a Minecraft survival multiplayer server
written in Java. It uses the Netty library for the networking code. Hopefully
it will eventually turn into something more feature-complete.

Although I researched the classic protocol completely myself for OpenCraft,
this time it had already been done by aera, ylt and TkTech so a big thanks to
them for saving loads of work!
