This is a skeleton implementation of a Minecraft survival multiplayer server written in Java. It uses the Netty library for the networking code.

Although I researched the classic protocol completely myself for OpenCraft, this time it had already been done by aera, ylt and TkTech here: http://wiki.tkte.ch/minecraft:protocol and here: http://wiki.tkte.ch/minecraft:login, so a big thanks to them for saving loads of work! This documentation is also mirrored on the wiki: http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Alpha_Packet_Protocol.

Since I'm in a linking mood, I may as well post the other relevant ones:
